    <p>Welcome to the site dedicated to programming languages!
Here you&rsquo;ll find the ranking of the most popular programming languages:</p>
<p><a href="/ranking">TIOBE</a></p>
<p>A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.[1]</p>
<p>Programming languages are described in terms of their syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), usually defined by a formal language. Most languages have a type system consisting of different data types (such as integers and strings) and catch type errors where one type is given where another is expected. Many support user-defined types including abstract data types, often used for object-oriented programming. Implementation in the form of a compiler or interpreter allows programs to be translated into machine code and executed.</p>
<p>Computer architecture has strongly influenced the design of programming languages, with the most common type (imperative languages—which implement operations in a specified order) developed to perform well on the popular von Neumann architecture. While early programming languages were closely tied to the hardware, over time, they have developed more abstraction to hide implementation details for greater simplicity.</p>
<p>Thousands of programming languages—often classified as imperative, functional, logic, or object-oriented—have been developed for a wide variety of uses. Many aspects of programming language design involve tradeoffs—for example, exception handling reduces errors at a performance cost—such that efforts to develop a universal programming language have failed. Programming language theory is the subfield of computer science that studies the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.</p>
